* Online - but disconnected

By 2011, 75% online Taiwanease are using Facebook.

However, netizens remained pessimistic about the
potential of existing social media outlets and
portals to spark civic empowerment — or even
engagement — online.

* Online - but disconnected

WIRED magazine: Do you see Facebook as an
instrument to encourage civic engagement?

Chang Ta-Chuen (張大春): No, I can most definitely
say, absolutely not. It makes citizens feel as if
they have participated. […] I still can’t see how
an actual, practical activism can succeed at
engaging people, as lazy as we are.
